    "# Introduction to PyMC\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic programming (PP) allows flexible specification of Bayesian statistical models in code. PyMC is a new, open-source PP framework with an intuitive and readable, yet powerful, syntax that is close to the natural syntax statisticians use to describe models. It features next-generation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS; Hoffman, 2014), a self-tuning variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC; Duane, 1987). This class of samplers works well on high dimensional and complex posterior distributions and allows many complex models to be fit without specialized knowledge about fitting algorithms. HMC and NUTS take advantage of gradient information from the likelihood to achieve much faster convergence than traditional sampling methods, especially for larger models. NUTS also has several self-tuning strategies for adaptively setting the tunable parameters of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which means you usually don't need to have specialized knowledge about how the algorithms work. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PyMC Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic programming in Python confers a number of advantages including multi-platform compatibility, an expressive yet clean and readable syntax, easy integration with other scientific libraries, and extensibility via C, C++, Fortran or Cython. These features make it relatively straightforward to write and use custom statistical distributions, samplers and transformation functions, as required by Bayesian analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC's feature set helps to make Bayesian analysis as painless as possible. Here is a short list of some of its features:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Fits Bayesian statistical models with Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational inference and\n",
    "    other algorithms.\n",
    "-   Includes a large suite of well-documented statistical distributions.\n",
    "-   Leverages `arviz` for convergence diagnostics, model checking methods and creating summaries including tables and plots.\n",
    "-   Extensible: easily incorporates custom step methods and unusual probability distributions.\n",
    "-   Non-parametric Bayesian methods, including Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we present a primer on the use of PyMC for solving general Bayesian statistical inference and prediction problems. We will first see the basics of how to use PyMC, motivated by a simple example: installation, data creation, model definition, model fitting and posterior analysis. Then we will cover two case studies and use them to show how to define and fit more sophisticated models. Finally we will show how to extend PyMC and discuss other useful features: the Generalized Linear Models subpackage, custom distributions, custom transformations and alternative storage backends."

    ">Since its represented by PyMC random variable object, `disasters` is defined by its dependence on its parent `rate` even though its value is **fixed**. This isn't just a quirk of PyMC's syntax; Bayesian hierarchical notation itself makes no distinction between random variables and data. The reason is simple: to use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior, we require the likelihood. Even though `disasters`'s value is known and fixed, we need to formally assign it a *probability distribution* as if it were a random variable. Remember, the likelihood and the probability function are essentially the same, except that the former is regarded as a function of the parameters and the latter as a function of the data. This point can be counterintuitive at first, as many peoples' instinct is to regard data as fixed a priori and unknown variables as dependent on the data. \n",

    "> One way to understand this is to think of statistical models as predictive models for data, or as models of the processes that gave rise to data. Before observing the value of `disasters`, we could have sampled from its prior predictive distribution $p(y)$ (*i.e.* the marginal distribution of the data) as follows:\n",
